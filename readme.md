# Overview

The goal of this thesis is to build a mathematical model of the electro-refining of copper process. This model will be abla to connect quantities measuerd by an NV Center based electric field sensor to quantities of interest, such as bulk concentration of Copper Sulfate, which is a salt in which copper comes bounded in its natural state.
