\subsection{Numeric Solution To The Diffusion Equation With Reaction At The Interface}


For this case (s=+), we have the same equation, but border conditions at the interface change a little. We have

\begin{align}
	\rho_+(\xi = 1, \tau) = 0, \\
	D \frac{\partial \rho_+}{\partial \xi} (\xi = 0, \tau) = \frac{\delta r}{C_b},\\
	\rho_+(\xi, \tau = 0) = -1.
\end{align}

Here, we have used the adimensional parameters 

\begin{align}
    \tau = \frac{D t }{\delta ^2},\\
    \xi = \delta x.
\end{align}


The approach in discretizing is exactly the same as in the previous case, with the exception of the first equation (k = 1) in which we get the following border condition

\begin{align}
    \frac{D}{\delta}\frac{\partial \rho_+}{\partial \xi} = \frac{r}{C_b}.
\end{align}

In discretized form

\begin{align}
    \frac{D}{\delta}\frac{(\rho_+^{n,1}-\rho_+^{n,0})}{\Delta \xi} = \frac{r}{C_b},
\end{align}

where $r$ is the reaction rate. In discretized form, this border condition can be written as

\begin{align}
    \rho_+^{n,0} = \rho_+^{n,1} - \frac{r\delta }{D C_b}\Delta \xi.
\end{align}


This means that the discrete equations are (in matrix form)

\begin{align}
    \bf{\underline{A}} \bf{\rho_+^{n+1}}  = \bf{\rho_+^n} + \bf{b},
\end{align}

where $\bf{\underline{A}}$ is the same as the diffusion-only case and 

\begin{align}
    \bf{b} = \begin{bmatrix}
                -\alpha\frac{r\delta}{DC_b} \Delta \xi\\
                0\\
                \vdots \\
                0
                \end{bmatrix}.
\end{align}

On the other hand,

\begin{align}
r = \frac{\partial C_s}{\partial t}\bigg|_{\xi = 0} = \frac{\partial zF C_s}{\partial t}\frac{1}{zF}\bigg|_{\xi = 0} = \frac{\partial Q_s}{\partial t}\frac{1}{zF}\bigg|_{\xi = 0} =  \frac{i_0}{zF}.
\end{align}
