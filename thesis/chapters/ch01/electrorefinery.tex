\subsection{Copper Electro-refining Process}

Copper ores are highly impure minerals which must be purified in order to meet industry standards of copper production lines in order to maintain desired properties of thermal and electrical conductivity. Electro-refining is the process through which impure copper anodes are dissolved into an electrolyte containing $CuSO_4$ and $H_2SO_4$ to rid the anode from impurities \cite{schlesinger}. Through this process copper anodes can be refined with a purity of $>\%99,997$ $Cu$.


The process of electro-refining can be studied as a redox reaction. The following chemical reactions take place:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Reduction at the anode: $Cu^0_{(s)} \rightarrow Cu^{2+} + 2e^-$ at $V_0 = -0.34V$.
	\item Oxidation at the cathode: $Cu^0_{(l) + 2e^-} \rightarrow Cu^{2+}_{(s)} $ at $V_0 = +0.34V$.
\end{enumerate}

To move from anode to cathode, the copper particles migrate by diffusion and convection processes, which have described in previous sections. The net reaction is then

\begin{align}
	Cu_{(impure)} \rightarrow Cu_{(pure)}.
\end{align}

Typical operational concentration of $Cu$ electrolyte are $40-50 g/l = 0.63 M$\cite{schlesinger}. Current per unit area is another parameter of interest. Greater current means faster purification but it could also mean a loss in the purity of the final cathode (due to other metallic impurities in the initial anode such as $Ag$). Nevertheless, operational current of $400 A/m^2$ is routinely achieved in such processes with modern electrolyte flow technology. The operational electrolyte temperature typically ranges from $60\deg$ to $75\deg$ celsius.

In electro-refining setups, electrolytes are constantly recirculated at a rate of $\approx 1.2 m^3/h$. Also, other impurities such as $As, Bi, Co, Fe$ among others are present in the purification of copper and do have effects over the speed of the process itself and also the ohmic resistance of the electrolye overall, but these impurities and the recirculation of the electrolyte will be neglected in this work.
