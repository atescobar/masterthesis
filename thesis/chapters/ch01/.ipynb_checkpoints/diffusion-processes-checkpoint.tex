\subsection{Historical Note}

\par Diffusion processes have been studied extencively in literature, although quantitative analysis of these phenomena where not described up until 1855 when Adolf Fick discovered the laws which take his names \cite{fick}. A way of thinking about this is imagining a particular setup in which we have a disolution  splitted by a small capilary layer. We have a concentration gradient (a difference in concentration) on each side of the interfacing layer. The flux is porportional to the concentration gradient over the area of the interface
