\section{Context Of This Work}
\label{sec:context}
This work is financed by the FONDEF ID $16I10214$ project, which has the main goal of building an electric field sensor to measure quantities related to the electro-refinement of copper. In that context, in this work we will connect the electric field fluctuations to the bulk concentration of copper in the in the electrolytic cell in which this process happens. In order to achieve this goal, an experimental team will use an NV-center based electric field sensor (\cite{Dolde2011}, \cite{NatureMaze}) to measure the noise produced by fluctuation charges ($Cu^{+2}$ and other electrolytes) at the electrode.
